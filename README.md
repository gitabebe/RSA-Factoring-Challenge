# RSA Factoring Challenge

This repository contains programs written for the RSA Factoring Challenge

## Tasks

* **0. Factorize all the things!**
  * Factorize as many numbers as possible into a product of two smaller numbers
  * Usage: factors <file>
  * where <file> is a file containing natural numbers to factor.
  * One number per line
  * Output format: n=p*q

* **1. RSA Factoring Challenge**
  * RSA Laboratories states that: for each RSA number n, there exist prime numbers p and q such that n = p Ã— q. The problem is to find these two primes, given only n
  * Usage: rsa <file>
